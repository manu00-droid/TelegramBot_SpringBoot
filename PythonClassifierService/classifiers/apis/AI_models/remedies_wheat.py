Biodiversity among wheat cultivars can also effectively check the rust problem. 
Use 3-4 wheat varieties at a time on each farm. Avoid late sowing or late 
maturing varieties. To protect the crop from rust infection, spray 5 liters of 
sour buttermilk mixed with 200 liter of water. Amaranth (chaulai or lal bhaji â€“ 
a common green leaf vegetable) or Mentha (Pudina) leaf dust can also be used as 
fine spray (25- 30 gm dry leaf powder per lit of water) to prevent the infection 
of rusts. Foliar spray of dry leaf extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (China 
rose) can also prevent the rust infection.

Dithane M-45 and 4 parts of Karathane-25 wettable powder. Spray mixture @ 2 
kg/ha dissolved in 1000 litres of water. About three sprays will be sufficient 
at an interval of 10-15 days. Amount of water for different sprays may be

Use a balanced mixture of an azole with a multisite (where possible). Only add an SDHI when disease risk merits it
Use the lowest dose possible to get the required control, but ensure that each component of the mix gives comparable levels of control
